        The Soma cube is a solid dissection puzzle invented by Piet Hein in
        1933[1] during a lecture on quantum mechanics conducted by Werner
        Heisenberg. Its name is alleged to be derived from the fictitious drug
        soma consumed as a pastime by the establishment in Aldous Huxley's
        dystopic novel Brave New World.[2] Seven pieces made out of unit cubes
        must be assembled into a 3×3×3 cube. The pieces can also be used to make
        a variety of other 3D shapes.
